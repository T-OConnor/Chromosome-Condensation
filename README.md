### About ‘Chromosome-condensation’

‘Chromosome-condesation’ code is a C++ biophysical software designed for Brownian dynamics of chromatin condensation with two distinct mechanisms – ‘diffusion capture’ which is based on pairwise interactions between chromatin loci or between particles mimicking condensin/cohesin, and ‘loop extrusion’, resulting in formation of chromatin loops. ‘Chromo-sim’ can be also used for simple Brownian dynamics simulations of free polymers without any condensation mechanisms (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02183-0). 
For in-depth description of the model and biophysical algorithms applied, please see doi:10.1093/nar/gkaa1270.


### Getting Started

This is an example of how you may set up the code running for your projects locally.

#### Prerequisites
-	C++ built-in
-	Visualization software such as Chimera, VMD or PyMOL

#### Installation
1.	You can download the code (`initConfig.hpp, initConfig.cpp, initDynamics.hpp, initDynamics.cpp, chromoCell.cpp, Makefile`)
2.	Or you can clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/FrancisCrickInstitute/Chromosome-Condensation


### Tutorial

First, create a folder where you want to run simulations:
`mkdir test_sim`

`cd test_sim`

Make sure you copy all the code files from chromo_sim_code to the folder where you want to run simulations:
`cp path_to_code_folder/chromo_sim_code/* ./ `

Next, set up parameters in the initConfig.hpp (for parameter description see **Documentation**) and then compile the code:
`make`

Run the simulation:
`./chromo`


### Output & visualization

The main output of code are PDB files from specific timepoints with coordinates of polymer and condensin/cohesin proteins. These can be visalized using Chimera, VMD or PyMOL. There are additional output files to monitor further events in the simulations (**Documentation**) you can opt for. 


### Documentation – parameters 

The ‘Chromosome-condensation’ code consists of several files:

- **initConfig.hpp** = includes parameter settings and declaration of functions that initialise the chromatin chain and binders
- **initConfig.cpp** = includes definition of functions that initialise the chromatin chain and binders
- **initDynamics.hpp** = includes declaration of functions that describe the dynamical evolution of chromatin chain and binders, including those detail rules of diffusion capture and loop extrusion
- **initDynamics.cpp** = includes definition of functions that describe the dynamical evolution of chromatin chain and binders, including those detail rules of diffusion capture and loop extrusion
- **chromoCell.cpp** = includes functions to call functions in files above to simulate the dynamical evolution of chromatin condensation


General parameter set up can be adjusted in **initConfig.hpp** file. **README_parameters.xlsx** contains more in-depth description of polymer simulation parameters.

Optional output files and their corresponding parameters are:
•	**_chromoPDB_*.pdb** = PDB file format of chromatin chain with binders/condensin in selected time point

•	**_DC_stats_index2.txt_** = number of diffusion capture interactions/pairs in time

•	**_binder_attach_site.txt_** = site on chromatin chain where binders are attached

•	**_loop_size.txt_** = loops sizes in time

•	**_nested_loops.txt_** = number of nested loops in time

•	**_voxMap_occupancy.txt_** = number of beads in each voxel

•	**_voxMap_occupancy2new.txt_** = number of occupied voxels

•	**_msd_bead_coord.txt_** = coordinate monitoring in selected time windows, used for further MSD and anisotropy calculations
